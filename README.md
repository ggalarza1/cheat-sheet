This cheat sheet contains code, I learned and want to keep close. These notebooks will also serve as guidance to help anyone who needs to refresh their skills in python within the finance sphere.

This folder will also contain notes on information I don't want to forget as I pursuit a career in technology.
I will continue to update it as I take more courses.

Some of the notebooks right now, come from examples from a python for finance course I took in Sacred Heart University.
